The get_string_width method allows determining the length of a string in the current font, which is used here to calculate the position and the width of the frame surrounding the title. Then colors are set (via set_draw_color, set_fill_color and set_text_color) and the thickness of the line is set to 1 mm (against 0.2 by default) with set_line_width. Finally, we output the cell (the last parameter to true indicates that the background must be filled).

df.query("col1 != 'a1' | year != 2011")

2012 1      c1   b2
